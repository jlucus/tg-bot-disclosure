# Telegram Bot API Vulnerability Report

## Overview

This report details a critical security vulnerability in the Telegram Bot API that allows former bot owners to retain access to various bot configuration endpoints after ownership transfer. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized modifications, service disruption, and potential privacy concerns.

## Vulnerability Details

**Vulnerability Type:** Improper Access Control / Permission Persistence  
**Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.0)  
**Affected Component:** Telegram Bot API  
**Affected API Version:** 9.0 (as of April 2025)

### Description

When a Telegram bot is transferred from one owner (User A) to another (User B) via BotFather, the original bot token remains unchanged. Our testing reveals that the former owner (User A) retains access to multiple Bot API endpoints, allowing them to modify bot settings, remove functionality, and potentially disrupt service even after they no longer own the bot.

This represents a significant security flaw as the previous owner should no longer have any access to the bot's configuration after transferring ownership.

## Affected Endpoints

Our automated endpoint enumeration has identified the following endpoints that remain accessible to the former owner after bot ownership transfer:

### Write Operations (Most Critical)

| Endpoint | Description | Security Impact |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `setMyCommands` | Set bot commands | Can remove or modify bot commands |
| `deleteMyCommands` | Delete bot commands | Can remove all bot commands |
| `setMyName` | Change bot name | Can modify bot identity |
| `setMyDescription` | Change bot description | Can modify bot information |
| `setMyShortDescription` | Change bot short description | Can modify bot information |
| `setChatMenuButton` | Set chat menu button | Can modify bot UI elements |
| `setMyDefaultAdministratorRights` | Set default admin rights | Can modify bot permissions |
| `setWebhook` | Set webhook URL | Can redirect bot updates to malicious server |
| `deleteWebhook` | Delete webhook | Can disrupt bot functionality |

### Read Operations (Lower Risk)

| Endpoint | Description | Security Impact |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `getMe` | Get bot information | Information disclosure |
| `getMyCommands` | Get bot commands | Information disclosure |
| `getMyName` | Get bot name | Information disclosure |
| `getMyDescription` | Get bot description | Information disclosure |
| `getMyShortDescription` | Get bot short description | Information disclosure |
| `getChatMenuButton` | Get chat menu button | Information disclosure |
| `getMyDefaultAdministratorRights` | Get default admin rights | Information disclosure |
| `getWebhookInfo` | Get webhook information | Information disclosure |

## Exploitation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Service Disruption

A malicious former owner could:
1. Remove all bot commands using `setMyCommands` with an empty list
2. Delete the webhook using `deleteWebhook`
3. Change the bot's name and description to something misleading using `setMyName` and `setMyDescription`

This would render the bot less functional and confuse users, potentially damaging the new owner's reputation.

### Scenario 2: Data Interception

A malicious former owner could:
1. Set a new webhook URL pointing to their own server using `setWebhook`
2. Intercept all incoming messages and updates to the bot
3. Potentially access sensitive information sent to the bot

This represents a serious privacy concern for users interacting with the bot.

### Scenario 3: Persistent Access

A malicious former owner could:
1. Periodically check if the bot is still active using `getMe`
2. Monitor changes made by the new owner using various `get*` endpoints
3. Revert or sabotage those changes using the corresponding `set*` endpoints

This allows for long-term interference with the bot's operation.

## Reproduction Steps

1. **Setup**: Create a bot via BotFather and note its token
2. **Pre-Transfer Testing**: Verify access to all API endpoints
3. **Transfer**: Transfer the bot to another user via BotFather
4. **Post-Transfer Testing**: Attempt to access the same endpoints using the original token
5. **Verification**: Document which endpoints remain accessible

Our testing confirms that all tested endpoints remain accessible to the former owner after transfer.

## Mitigation Recommendations

1. **Token Regeneration**: Automatically generate a new bot token upon ownership transfer
2. **Access Revocation**: Immediately invalidate the old token when ownership is transferred
3. **Permission Checks**: Implement consistent permission checks across all Bot API endpoints
4. **Transfer Confirmation**: Require confirmation from both parties and warn about security implications
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation to clearly explain the security implications of bot transfers

## Conclusion

This vulnerability represents a significant security risk for Telegram bots that change ownership. The fact that former owners retain access to critical configuration endpoints violates the principle of least privilege and creates multiple avenues for abuse.

We recommend that Telegram address this issue urgently by implementing token regeneration upon ownership transfer and ensuring proper access control across all Bot API endpoints.
