# Telegram Hostile Bot: Theory

Imagine you hire me, the best bot developer in the planet because you came to my page! 

"Hey, I want to hire you to build my bot, will you do it?"

So I build your bot and then, send it to you. You could also do things like the minting of a @ handle on TON in theory.

You hand it off by transfering it to the new owner.

Now you exploit!
